## 🎯 Key Achievements

* **91% peak accuracy** across multiple equipment types
* **<100ms prediction latency** for real-time inference
* **End-to-end pipeline**: data ingestion → preprocessing → model training → API serving → containerized deployment
* **Production-ready** FastAPI service with health checks, structured logging, and Pydantic validation
* **Automated CI/CD** with GitHub Actions for Docker build, ECR push, and ECS deployment
* **Scalable, cloud-ready** architecture using AWS ECR + ECS

## 📊 Project Overview

Predictive maintenance enables manufacturers to **preempt costly machine breakdowns**, improving operational efficiency and reducing downtime.
This system ingests **sensor data** (temperature, torque, speed, tool wear), trains ML models, and serves predictions via a **scalable API**, ready for production.

---

## 🛠 Technical Stack

**Machine Learning & Data:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, SMOTE
**API & Validation:** FastAPI, Pydantic
**MLOps & Experiment Tracking:** MLflow (experiments & model registry)
**Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
**CI/CD & Automation:** GitHub Actions (build → test → push → deploy)
**Cloud Deployment:** AWS ECR, ECS (production-ready, auto-scalable)
**Monitoring:** Structured logging, health endpoints, and API metrics

---

## 🏗 Architecture

```
Data → ETL → Model Training (MLflow) → Model Registry → API (FastAPI) 
→ Docker Container → GitHub Actions CI/CD → AWS ECR → ECS Production
```

**Highlights:**

* Fully **containerized ML service** for consistency across dev, staging, and prod
* Automated **CI/CD pipeline** ensures code & model changes are instantly deployed
* Cloud-ready deployment enables **horizontal scaling and high availability**
